# The-Crusader
"The Crusader" is a powerful Python script that scans web servers and WordPress installations for malware and other types of malicious software. It sends an alert email and text message to the website owner if it finds any issues. This tool helps cybersecurity analysts to protect their web assets and prevent cyber attacks.

Here's a general how-to guide to get started with using The Crusader:

== Install necessary packages: ==
Install Python 3
Install the requests package: pip install requests
Install the beautifulsoup4 package: pip install beautifulsoup4
Install the twilio package: pip install twilio (if you want to use SMS notifications)
Set up a Twilio account (if you want to use SMS notifications):
Go to https://www.twilio.com/ and sign up for an account.
Follow the instructions to create a new project and obtain a Twilio account SID and auth token.
Purchase a phone number to use for sending SMS notifications.
Modify the script with your website URL and email/SMS information:
Open the wordpress_malware_scanner.py file in a text editor.
Change the url variable to the URL of the WordPress website you want to scan.
If you want to receive SMS notifications, change the twilio_account_sid, twilio_auth_token, and twilio_phone_number variables to your Twilio account SID, auth token, and purchased phone number.
Change the recipient_email and recipient_phone variables to your email address and/or phone number.
Run the script:
Save the modified wordpress_malware_scanner.py file.
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
Run the script with the command python3 wordpress_malware_scanner.py.
Automate the script with a cron job:
Open a terminal/command prompt and enter the command crontab -e.
Add a new line to the file with the desired schedule and the command to run the script. For example, to run the script every day at 9:00am, add the line 0 9 * * * python3 /path/to/wordpress_malware_scanner.py.
Save and close the crontab file.
Check for email/SMS notifications:
If malware is found on the website, an email and/or SMS notification will be sent to the specified email address and/or phone number.
Check your email and/or phone for any notifications.
Note: This guide assumes a basic understanding of Python and command line usage. If you encounter any issues, consult the official documentation for the packages used in the script or seek assistance from a qualified developer.
